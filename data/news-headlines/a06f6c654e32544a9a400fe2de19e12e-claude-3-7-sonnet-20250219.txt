Okay, let's tackle this rating. First, I need to carefully read the article and the generated headline and lead. The article talks about US regulators planning to reduce capital rules for banks, part of Trump's deregulation efforts. The headline is "US Set to Slash Bank Capital Rules in Major Post-Crisis Rollback" and the lead mentions preparing to cut requirements this summer as part of Trump's agenda.

Checking the headline guidelines: It's clear and uses strong verbs like "slash" and "rollback." It mentions the main action and the significance. But "slash" might be a bit sensational. The lead answers the Five Ws: who (US regulators), what (cutting capital requirements), when (this summer), why (Trump's deregulation). It's concise, around 30 words. 

Looking for inaccuracies. The article says the proposals are expected this summer, which the lead correctly states. The headline's "slash" might be an overstatement compared to the article's "cutting" or "modifications." The article also mentions the UK's response and other details, but the headline and lead focus on the US action, which is the main point. 

Potential issues: The headline uses "slash," which could be seen as sensational, but the article does mention "biggest rollback," so maybe it's justified. The lead accurately ties it to Trump's agenda. No misinformation detected. Coherence between headline and lead is good; both focus on the rollback and Trump's role. 

Rating: The headline and lead are accurate, concise, and aligned. Maybe "slash" is a bit strong, but the article supports it with "biggest rollback." Minor issues, so a 4 or 5. Since everything checks out and they work well together, I'll go with 5.

Okay, let's tackle this rating. First, I need to understand the article and then evaluate the headline and lead provided.

The article is about US regulators planning to reduce bank capital requirements that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. The main points are the scaling back of the supplementary leverage ratio, lobbying by banks, the timing under Trump's administration, and concerns from critics. There's also mention of the UK's reaction and potential delays in their own regulations.

Looking at the headline: "US Set to Slash Bank Capital Rules in Major Post-Crisis Rollback." The word "slash" is strong and might be a bit sensational, but it's accurate based on the sources. The article mentions "substantial cuts" and "largest in more than a decade," so "major rollback" fits. The headline is clear and concise.

The lead: It states that regulators are preparing to cut requirements this summer, part of Trump's deregulation. It answers who (US regulators), what (cutting capital requirements), when (this summer), why (Trump's agenda). The lead is concise, around 40 words. It aligns with the article's content, especially the FT report [1] and the timeline from [3] and [4].

Checking for inaccuracies: The headline uses "slash," which matches the article's "substantial cuts." The lead mentions "biggest rollback in over a decade," which is supported by [1]. The sources [1], [3], [4] all discuss the regulatory changes and timing. No misinformation here.

Coherence between headline and lead: Both focus on the rollback, Trump's role, and the post-crisis context. They work together well without contradiction.

Potential issues: The headline's "slash" might be seen as slightly sensational, but the article does use terms like "substantial cuts," so it's justified. The lead could mention the banking industry's lobbying, but it's not necessary for brevity. The lead accurately captures the key points without unnecessary details.

Rating: The headline and lead are accurate, concise, and aligned with the article. They meet the guidelines without major issues. Minor improvements could be adding "lobbying" context, but it's not essential. So, a score of 2 seems appropriate as it's good with minor room for improvement.
</think>

**Headline Observations**  
- **Clarity & Accuracy**: The term "slash" aligns with the article's description of "substantial cuts" [1], and "post-crisis rollback" accurately reflects the 2008 reforms [1][5].  
- **Sensationalism**: While "slash" is attention-grabbing, it mirrors the article’s tone and industry concerns [1][5], avoiding exaggeration.  

**Lead Observations**  
- **Five Ws**: Covers *who* (US regulators), *what* (cutting capital requirements), *when* (this summer), *why* (Trump’s deregulation agenda) [1][3][4]. Missing *where* (US-specific) is implied.  
- **Conciseness**: At 38 words, it adheres to length guidelines.  

**Coherence & Alignment**  
- The headline and lead jointly emphasize the scale ("biggest rollback") and political context (Trump’s agenda), matching the article’s focus [1][3][5].  
- No misinformation: Both reflect the FT’s reporting on timing, industry lobbying, and regulatory intent [1][4].  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The lead could briefly note banking industry lobbying, a key driver per the article [1][5].  
- "Slash" risks oversimplifying nuanced regulatory adjustments, though it matches the article’s framing.  

**Overall Impression**  
The headline and lead are accurate, concise, and well-aligned with the article. Minor additions (e.g., lobbying context) would enhance completeness but are not critical.
