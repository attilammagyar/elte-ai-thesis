Okay, let's tackle this rating. First, I need to understand the article's main points. The article discusses US regulators planning to reduce post-2008 financial crisis capital rules for banks, influenced by Trump's deregulation push and banking industry lobbying. Key points include the proposed changes to the supplementary leverage ratio, the context of Trump's regulatory rollback promises, and reactions from critics and the UK.

Now, looking at the headline: "US Poised to Weaken Post-Crash Bank Rules." It's concise and uses active voice ("Weaken") which is good. "Post-Crash" clearly refers to the 2008 crisis. However, "Weaken" might be slightly subjective; maybe "Ease" would be more neutral. But it's still accurate.

The lead: It mentions US watchdogs, influenced by lobbying and Trump, proposing cuts to capital rules established post-2008. It answers who, what, when, why. The lead is a bit long—maybe over 40 words. Also, "significant cuts" could be seen as editorializing. The article says "slash" and "cut," so "significant" is okay, but maybe "proposed reductions" would be more neutral.

Checking for accuracy: The headline and lead align with the article's content. The article does mention the summer proposals, Trump's influence, and lobbying. No misinformation here.

Coherence between headline and lead: The headline sets the action (weakening rules), and the lead provides context (lobbying, Trump's drive). They work together well.

Potential issues: The lead is a bit wordy. Also, "key capital rules" is vague; specifying the leverage ratio might be better, but the article doesn't explicitly name it in the lead. The headline uses "Post-Crash" which is clear but informal. Maybe "Post-2008" would be more precise.

AI weaknesses: The lead could be more concise. Also, "heavily influenced" might overstate the article's mention of lobbying as a factor. The article says "follows heavy lobbying," so "influenced by" is accurate. No hallucinations detected.

Overall, the headline and lead are accurate and coherent. The main improvements would be conciseness in the lead and possibly more neutral language. But they effectively summarize the article. I'd rate this a 4 because it's good but has minor areas for tweaking.

Okay, let's tackle this rating. First, I need to carefully read the article and then evaluate the provided headline and lead based on the guidelines given.

Starting with the article: It's about US regulators planning to reduce bank capital requirements that were put in place after the 2008 crisis. The main points are the scaling back of the supplementary leverage ratio, lobbying by banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, the timing under Trump's deregulation push, and concerns from critics. There's also mention of the UK's reaction and potential regulatory changes there.

Now, looking at the headline: "US Poised to Weaken Post-Crash Bank Rules". The headline is concise and uses active language. "Poised to Weaken" is strong but not sensational. It clearly indicates the action (weakening) and the subject (post-crash bank rules). However, "post-crash" might be a bit vague—does it refer to the 2008 crisis specifically? The article mentions "post-crisis protections", so maybe "post-crisis" would be more accurate. Also, "weaken" might be slightly subjective; the article uses terms like "slash" and "cuts", which are more direct. But overall, the headline is clear and grabs attention without being over the top.

The lead: "US financial watchdogs, influenced by heavy bank lobbying and Donald Trump's deregulation drive, are reportedly set to propose significant cuts this summer to key capital rules for major banks that were established after the 2008 financial crisis." It answers the who (US watchdogs, influenced by banks and Trump), what (propose significant cuts), when (this summer), where (US), why (deregulation drive and lobbying). It's a bit long—around 40 words, which is at the upper limit. The lead mentions the key points but could be more concise. For example, "reportedly set to propose" is a bit wordy. Also, the article mentions the supplementary leverage ratio specifically, but the lead just says "key capital rules", which is a bit vague. However, it does capture the main elements without inaccuracies.

Checking for typical AI issues: No misinformation apparent. The headline and lead align with the article's content. The headline uses "weaken" while the article uses "slash", which are similar in meaning here. The lead accurately reflects the influence of lobbying and Trump's policies. There's no hallucination; all details are present in the article. Coherence between headline and lead is good—both focus on the deregulation of post-2008 rules.

Potential improvements: The headline could specify "post-2008" instead of "post-crash" for clarity. The lead might benefit from tightening the wording to be more concise, perhaps by removing "reportedly" if the article's sources are clear, but the article does cite the Financial Times and unnamed sources, so "reportedly" is appropriate. Also, mentioning the supplementary leverage ratio in the lead could add specificity, but the guidelines say the lead should be brief, so maybe that's okay to omit.

Rating: Considering the guidelines, this is a solid effort. The headline and lead are accurate, clear, and aligned. Minor issues with word choice and conciseness, but nothing major. I'd rate it a 2 because there's room for minor improvements, like clarifying "post-crash" and tightening the lead's wording, but overall it's good.
</think>

**Headline Evaluation**  
The headline "US Poised to Weaken Post-Crash Bank Rules" is concise and uses active language ("weaken") to convey urgency. However, "post-crash" is vague and could be misinterpreted, as the article specifically references the 2008 financial crisis. Replacing it with "post-2008" would improve clarity. While "weaken" aligns with the article’s tone, terms like "slash" or "cut" from the source material might better reflect the severity of the regulatory change[1][3].  

**Lead Evaluation**  
The lead effectively answers the Five Ws:  
- **Who**: US financial watchdogs  
- **What**: Proposing significant cuts to capital rules  
- **When**: This summer  
- **Why**: Influenced by bank lobbying and Trump’s deregulation agenda  
- **Where**: US  

However, at 40 words, it pushes the upper limit of brevity. Phrases like "reportedly set to propose" could be streamlined (e.g., "will propose") without losing accuracy[1][5]. Additionally, specifying the *supplementary leverage ratio* as the targeted rule would add precision, though the guidelines prioritize brevity over granular detail.  

**Coherence and Accuracy**  
The headline and lead align well with the article’s focus on deregulation driven by lobbying and political shifts. No factual inaccuracies or hallucinations are present. Both elements avoid sensationalism while highlighting the tension between industry pressure and financial safeguards[1][4].  

**Areas for Improvement**  
1. **Headline**: Replace "post-crash" with "post-2008" for specificity.  
2. **Lead**: Shorten to 30-35 words by trimming redundant phrasing (e.g., "reportedly").  
3. **Specificity**: Mention the *supplementary leverage ratio* in the lead if space permits.  

**Overall Impression**  
The headline and lead are accurate and coherent but could be slightly refined for clarity and conciseness. They effectively summarize the article’s core without exaggeration or omission.  

**Rating**: 2
