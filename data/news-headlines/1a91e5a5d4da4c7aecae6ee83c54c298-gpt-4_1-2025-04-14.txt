Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to rate the headline and lead provided for a news article based on the given guidelines. First, I need to understand the article's content. The main points are about EU lawmakers proposing grid modernization after a blackout in the Iberian Peninsula. They emphasize investment, cross-border coordination, and regulatory changes.

Looking at the headline: "EU Lawmakers Push for Power Grid Overhaul After Major Blackout." It's clear and uses active language. "Push" is a strong verb. It mentions the cause (blackout) and the action (overhaul), which aligns with the article. The term "overhaul" might be a bit strong, but the article does talk about significant investments and reforms, so it's justified.

The lead: "In response to the April blackout in the Iberian Peninsula, EU lawmakers on Tuesday proposed urgent investment and reforms to modernise Europe’s electricity grids and secure the continent’s renewable energy future." It answers the Five Ws—who (EU lawmakers), what (proposed investment and reforms), when (Tuesday), where (Europe), why (response to blackout, secure renewable future). It's concise, under 40 words. The mention of "urgent" reflects the article's emphasis on immediate action post-blackout.

Checking for AI issues: The headline and lead accurately reflect the article's content. No misinformation here. The blackout date in the article is April 28, 2025, and the lead correctly states "April blackout." The term "overhaul" matches the proposed grid action plan and investments. The lead's mention of "secure renewable energy future" ties into the EU's goals mentioned in the article. Coherence between headline and lead is good; both focus on the blackout as the catalyst for proposed changes.

Possible improvements: The headline could specify the Iberian Peninsula, but "major blackout" is sufficient. The lead might benefit from mentioning the €584 billion investment figure, but it's already concise. Overall, both are accurate, clear, and aligned with the article. No major issues detected. Rating: 5.

I'll evaluate the headline and lead based on the article content and journalistic standards.

**Headline Analysis:**
"EU Lawmakers Push for Power Grid Overhaul After Major Blackout"
- Clear and understandable at a glance
- Accurately reflects the article's focus on grid modernization
- Correctly identifies EU lawmakers as the actors
- Appropriately mentions the blackout, which is referenced in the article
- Uses active language without being sensational

**Lead Analysis:**
"In response to the April blackout in the Iberian Peninsula, EU lawmakers on Tuesday proposed urgent investment and reforms to modernise Europe's electricity grids and secure the continent's renewable energy future."
- Covers most of the Five Ws (who: EU lawmakers, what: proposed investment/reforms, when: Tuesday, why: in response to blackout)
- Appropriate length (30 words)
- However, presents a causal relationship that may be overstated - the article doesn't explicitly state the proposals were made "in response to" the blackout, though the blackout is mentioned as an example of why grid resilience is needed
- The lead somewhat overemphasizes the blackout as the primary driver, when the article presents it as one example among broader concerns

**Overall Impression:**
The headline is accurate and effective. The lead is generally good but slightly mischaracterizes the relationship between the blackout and the proposals. The article indicates the blackout was "a critical example" rather than the direct cause of the proposals. The proposals appear to be part of a broader initiative to modernize grid infrastructure for renewable energy integration, with the blackout serving as an illustrative case. This is a relatively minor issue that doesn't significantly distort the article's meaning.

*   The word "urgent" is an interpretation based on the context of the "critical" blackout and the MEP's call for decisive action, rather than a direct descriptor used in the article for the proposals themselves, but it is a reasonable inference.
*   It aligns well with the headline and the article's core message.

**Overall Impression:**
The headline and lead are of good quality and work well together to represent the article's main thrust. They are accurate in conveying that EU lawmakers are proposing significant changes to the electricity grid in response to a major blackout, with the aim of modernization and supporting renewable energy. The language is engaging. The use of "Overhaul" in the headline and "urgent" in the lead are strong journalistic choices that capture the gravity and scope, though they are interpretations rather than direct quotations of the article's terminology for the proposals. There are no significant inaccuracies or AI-specific problems like hallucination.

Okay, let's tackle this rating. First, I need to understand the article's main points. The article discusses EU lawmakers proposing grid modernization after a blackout in the Iberian Peninsula. They emphasize investment, cross-border coordination, and infrastructure upgrades to support renewable energy.

Now, looking at the headline: "EU Lawmakers Push for Power Grid Overhaul After Major Blackout." It mentions the key players (EU lawmakers), the action (push for overhaul), and the catalyst (major blackout). The blackout is correctly identified as Iberian, but the headline just says "major," which might be a bit vague. However, it's concise and attention-grabbing without being sensational.

The lead: "In response to the April blackout in the Iberian Peninsula, EU lawmakers on Tuesday proposed urgent investment and reforms to modernise Europe’s electricity grids and secure the continent’s renewable energy future." It answers the Five Ws—who (EU lawmakers), what (proposed investment and reforms), when (Tuesday, April blackout), where (Iberian Peninsula, Europe), why (secure renewable energy). It's brief, around 40 words, and aligns with the headline.

Checking for inaccuracies. The article mentions the blackout occurred on April 28, 2025, and the proposal was adopted on Tuesday (the article's date is May 20, 2025, so the Tuesday would be May 20). The lead says "April blackout," which is correct. The headline's "major blackout" matches the article's description. The proposals include an EU grid action plan, investment, and reforms, which the lead accurately summarizes.

Coherence between headline and lead: Both focus on the blackout as the catalyst and the lawmakers' response. They work together without contradiction. The lead provides specifics the headline alludes to.

Potential issues: The headline uses "overhaul," which is a strong term. The article talks about modernization and upgrades, which might be slightly less drastic than an overhaul, but it's a reasonable simplification. The lead mentions "urgent investment," which aligns with the article's call for significant funding. No hallucinations detected; all info matches the article.

Possible improvements: The headline could specify "Iberian Peninsula" instead of "Major" for clarity, but it's still accurate. The lead is solid, maybe could mention the committee (Industry, Research and Energy Committee) but it's not essential. Overall, minor tweaks possible but not necessary. 

Rating: 2. It's good with minor room for improvement, like specifying the blackout's location in the headline, but overall accurate and coherent.
