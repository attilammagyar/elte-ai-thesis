    "a piece of text in some language, be it a natural language or a formal\n",
    "one like programming languages. The interpretation of the tokens depends\n",
    "on the exact tokenization strategy used, which may define tokens as\n",
    "words, word pieces, n-grams, or individual characters, and spaces,\n",
    "punctuation marks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding** is the process which converts human-readable textual\n",
    "tokens into integers which uniquely identify each token within the\n",
    "predetermined vocabulary of the model, and the inverse of this mapping\n",
    "is called **decoding**. \n",

    "Text generation is an autoregressive process where given a\n",
    "sequence of tokens as a prefix &mdash; known as the **prompt** &mdash; the\n",
    "model estimates the probability distribution of the next token, takes a\n",
    "sample from that distribution, appends it to the sequence, and repeats\n",

    "A frequently used parameter to control the sampling is called the\n",

    " * **Chain-of-thought** <sup>[17,27]</sup>: taking\n",
    "   advantage of the autoregressive text generation, asking the\n",
    "   LLM-judge to solve the original problem independently from the\n",
